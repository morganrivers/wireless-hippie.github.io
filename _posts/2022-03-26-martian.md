A lot of the times I start to write something for this blog I write "this is one of the best experiences of my life", this time I'm going to write about the best experience of my life.

I spent the last three months of my life living in the middle of a toxic wasteland in the Bombay Beach desert.

This place feels like the edge of the world, I wonder if the settlers of the far west felt the same way I do in here, an anarchist, impossible dead land that exists in the faint equilibrium between the everything and the nothingness.

The kinds of people you will find in southern west California are on the edge of society, they're marginals, they're outsiders, they're scum, they're artists, they're nerds, they don't fit in, they're unstable, they're rich, they're miserable, they're humble, they're full of stories, they're running away, they're hiding, they're creating, they're being reborn in the toxicity of the Salton Sea.

I've watched myself to play many roles in a Hollywood-like-movie this winter. I was an extra, passively watching the world unveiling around me, mesmerized with people's magnetism, intelligence, sexuality, kindess and madness. I've watched myself play the main role in people's life and make long lasting impressions. I taught and learned lessons. I felt so full and so empty, so important, so irrelevant. I had all this time to feel and I'm so grateful. (Grateful every time the train passes by).

I've felt the cold and the beauty of waking up at 5am in the desert and to pee while I heard the coyotes howling not too far away and to brush my teeths as the sunrise painted the sky in pink and orange and purple with little fluffy clouds decorating the horizon and the mountains framing the dreamy landscape. I quieted the mind and opened the heart. Every morning I prayed for the sun to come up and was grateful for its warmth. Every morning for a long time.

I shared my very few very precious spiritual practices with strangers that later on I came to love. Some of them were gone but a friend taught me how everyone that touches you live for ever through you. I also learned loss is a facet of pain, that's an inevitable part of life, and that suffering is a choice within you.

I've recuperated my long lost loves for [so many things](cyborgdream.github.io/).

I was healed.

It was suddenly so cool to like what I liked and have long discussions about all of these things.

I was accepted.

It was so fullfilling and easy to get into the flux and don't see the hours passing and feel like a kid again.

I had arrived.

I met a few of the most incredible people I ever met in my life. I learned so much about the restorative power of communities and now I can't see my life without it. Everything looks so much clearer after I waited for the ripples to dissipate.

I left my castle.

I saw an old man, a sick man and a dying man.

And now I can't go back to it.
