A lot of the times I start to write something for this blog I write "this is one of the best experiences of my life", this time I'm going to write about the best experience of my life.

I spent the last three months of my life living in the middle of a toxic wasteland in the Bombay Beach desert.

This place feels like the edge of the world, I wonder if the settlers of the far west felt the same way I do in here, an anarchist, impossible dead land that exists in the faint equilibrium between the everything and the nothingness.

The people you find in southern west California are on the edge of society, they're marginals, they're outsiders, they're scum, they're artists, they're nerds, they're [martians](https://mars.college), they don't fit in, they're unstable, they're rich, they're miserable, they're humble, they're full of stories, they're running away, they're hiding, they're creating, they're being reborn in the toxicity of the Salton Sea.

I've watched myself to play many roles in a Hollywood-like-movie this winter. I was an extra, passively watching the world unveiling around me, mesmerized with people's magnetism, intelligence, sexuality, kindess and madness. I've watched myself play the main role in people's life and make long lasting life impressions, I taught and learned lessons. I felt so full and so empty, so important, so irrelevant. I had all this time to feel and I'm so grateful. (Grateful every time the train passes by).

I've felt the cold and the beauty of waking up at 5am in the desert and to pee while I heard the cayottes howling not too far away and to brush my teeths as the sunrise painted the sky in pink and orange and purple with little fluffy clouds decorating the horizon and the mountains framing this dreamy landscape.

I shuted up and listened to myself. Every morning I prayed for the sun to come up and was grateful for its rise. Every morning for a long time.

I shared my very few very precious spiritual practices with strangers that later on I became passionated about. Some of them were gone, but it doesn't matter, because as a friend taught me "people live within us forever".

I've recuperated my long lost loves for so many things.

I was healed.

It was suddenly so cool to like what I liked and have long discussions about all of these things.

I was accepted.

It was so fullfilling and easy to get into the flux and don't see the hours passing and feel like a kid again.

I had arrived.

I met a few of the most incredible people I ever met in my life. I learned so much about the restorative power of communities and now I can't see my life without it. Turning my life away from people doesn't make the least sense anymore and everything looks so much clearer.

I left my castle.

I saw an old man, a sick man and a dying man.

And now I can't go back to it.
