Hello hippies,
I've just lived an incredible experience I'd like to share with you. This is mainly about how I felt about it, it's about love, openness and acceptance. Maybe it inspires you to seek for something similar!

First, some updates about corona: I'm fully vaccinated. Science is a wonderful thing! I'm back in Germany and the numbers here are very manageable, which allows us to live a close to normal life.

I'm happy. Of course I'm happy. But to start life again, talking to people for hours, meeting them in parks, sitting straight on a picnic cloth, and sharing food, do we hug or not,  why is this still a question, can I share my cigarette? Well, I'm healthy but there are still other diseases around right, oh man, my back hurts, my couch is much better, why did I come etc. etc. etc. I just wanted to write it here, that was a couple of tough months and only now I'm being able to turn off this mindset a bit and come back to some "normality", you're not alone finding this is difficult.

Well, now to the easy things: I've been to my first burner gathering this past weekend. What is a burner? You might have heard of Burning Man, the huge festival happening in whatever desert in the US, maybe even about the [10 principles]() that rules the event, but the kind I'm talking about is very different. It was a small event, less than 200 people, we camped in Germany countryside for 4 days and it felt like a parallel universe of pure love and kindness where everyone was doing their best to make everyone around them happier.

This festival wasn't about getting high on amphetamines and alcohol and passing out in your tent while 180bpm music is literally blasting your tent out. I think that's why people insist in not calling it a festival. It was about connecting with the inner you of people. I had no idea something in this scale was possible.

>"[The Japanese people] are so crafty in their hearts that nobody can understand them. Whence it is said that they have three hearts: a false one in their mouths for all the world to see, another within their breasts only for their friends, and the third in the depths of their hearts, reserved for themselves alone and never manifested to anybody."

>From História da Igreja do Japão vol I pg 173, written by Father João Rodrigues, SJ.

I felt like as if people were living their third hidden heart openly, sharing it with whoever wanted to see it and take part on it. And that was exactly what I was looking for. After so many months of seclusion and loneliness, connecting to people be them my friends, strangers, anyone, everyone, is what I strived for the most (even though it's hard! It's a bit of a contradictory feeling with this one that I talked about earlier, I know! at the same time I want to open up and embrace the world, I want to curl up and lay on my balcony's floor, but they're all here, I'm just choosing wich one to follow).

I happened to develop I really deep relation with tattoos in the last few months and I just got a new one done. It's Haku from Spirited Away, to me it represents how important it is to accept help.

This burner showed me how rewarding it is to accept help, open up and be fragile. It showed me again how we're all just humans, struggling with such similar things and striving for such similar things and being content with such similar things. There was people from all around the world in this festival, but it didn't really matter where you came from, I'd connect with you the same.

I loved to see people's third heart and to show mine. I'm thankful for all the beautiful souls that shared this event with me and made it so whimsical. Every and each one of them had their part. You made a deep impression on me and now that I know that this kind of connection is possible with strangers I'll try to replicate it more often on the real world. Thank you hippies.

Many many leafy and dusty hugs.

I hope to see you all again and again and again.
